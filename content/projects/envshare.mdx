title: The Natives POV
description: Raincheck...from 2018-2020, I lead a volunteer-based language exchange program, The Natives POV, to promote language learning, cultural understanding, and global citizenship through technology. After getting more involved in the tech field I felt like there was a way to bridge the gap using technology like AR/VR to make langauge learning more accessible to anyone no matter their circumstances.

For fun I sometimes dive into Unreal Engine Metahumans -- this is a fun passion project for me.
